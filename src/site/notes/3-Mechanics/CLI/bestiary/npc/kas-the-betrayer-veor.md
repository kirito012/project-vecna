# [Kas the Betrayer](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/kas-the-betrayer-veor.md)
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 244*  

The Betrayer, the Bloody Handed, the Destroyerâ€”Kas has earned many epithets during his long existence. He is a vampire, legendary swordfighter, and ruthless warlord, and he is driven primarily by one thing: his hatred for Vecna.

Kas resembles a well-muscled, raven-haired, human man in his thirties, though he is far older. His fangs reveal his vampiric nature.

## Personality

Kas is cruel, spiteful, and unrelenting in his pursuit of vengeance against Vecna. He readily lies, breaks promises, betrays allies, and taunts those who fall for his ruses. Kas has little use for those who can't validate his superiority or help advance his goals.
